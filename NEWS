changes in KiT 1.4
  * Wavelet spot finder with adaptive threshold setting

changes in KiT 1.1 relative to 1.0

  * Fixed bug in default timesteps when no metadata available (CAS)

  * Image coordinate system now works on untracked channels

  * Image coordinate system more robust due to filtering spots and background

changes in KiT 1.0 relative to original code

  * GUI frontend improved for easy jobset creation

  * Support OME-TIFF and DV (and anything else) through Loci Tools - including
    autodownloader for the library

  * Only frame currently being analyzed is loaded, reducing memory requirement

  * Support for 2D tracking via image moment coordinate system

  * Support for measuring intensity local to tracked spots

  * Support for quick movie rendering with tracked spots and frame registration

  * Remove track analysis capability - see CupL - replaced with simple
    diagnostic tools (kitPlateCheck, kitPlotSisters)

  * Lots of unused/obsolete old code excised

  * Myriad performance improvements in grouping sisters, mixture-model fitting,
    etc...  without using MEX-files

  * Use 3D Gaussian PSF approx for clustering spots in mixture-model fitting
    instead of cubes

  * Simplified code by removing time integration of image and background - had
    very small effect in testing

  * Use Gaussian background for MMF spot detection - much smoother.

  * Bugfix: 3D PSF sigma not accounted for when removing superfluous maxima in
    detectSubResFeatures3D.m

  * Bugfix: F-test of fit against background p-value test had wrong direction
